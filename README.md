The main goal of this project is to create a system able to provide answers to specific biological research questions around the data acumulated from different experiments and annotations. 

The questions or use cases will be defined previous to the development, in this way we garantee that the platform, once completely developed is able to satisfy real needs of the community.

How to contribute
-----------------

The master branch will contain horizontal functionalities that are common to all the use cases. Please create a new brach for each new use case you pretend to solve within the system. As an example the branch "Variant annotations" will hold the developments around the genomic variant annotation functionality.
